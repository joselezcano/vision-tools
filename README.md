Android application to explore Google Vision API features.

## Overview

## Instructions
1. Start a project in Google Cloud Console.
2. Activate Vision API for your project.
3. Create an API key to make authenticated calls to Vision API on behalf of your cloud project.
4. Insert that API key in TextDetection, LabelDetection and FaceDetection Activities (look for the string 'CLOUD_VISION_API_KEY').

That's it! You can start exploring new uses of this technology in your own applications.
